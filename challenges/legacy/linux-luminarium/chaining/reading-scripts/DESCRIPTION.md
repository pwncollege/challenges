You're not the only one who writes shell scripts!
They are very handy for doing simple "system-level" tasks, and are a common tool that developers and sysadmins reach for.
In fact, a surprising fraction of the programs on a typical Linux machine are shell scripts.

In this level, we will learn to read shell scripts.
`/challenge/run` is a shell script that requires you to put in a secret password, but that password is hardcoded into the script iself!
Read the script (using, say, `cat`), figure out the password, and get the flag!

**NOTE:**
Feel free to try to read the code of other challenges as well!
Reading code is a critical strategy in learning new skills, because you can see how certain functionality was implemented and reuse those strategies in your own scripts.
But watch out: some program files are machine code, and will not be readable to humans.
You can use the `file` command to differentiate, but almost all the challenges in the Linux Luminarium are implemented as shell scripts and are safe to `cat` out.
