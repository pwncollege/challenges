Of course, you can also _create_ files!
There are several ways to do this, but we'll look at a simple command here.
You can create a new, blank file by _touching_ it with the `touch` command:

```
hacker@dojo:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ touch pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$
```

It's that simple!
In this level, please create two files: `/tmp/pwn` and `/tmp/college`, and run `/challenge/run` to get your flag!
