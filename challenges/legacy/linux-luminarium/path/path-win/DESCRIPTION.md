Okay, so things break when you blank out `PATH`.
But what about doing something _useful_ with `PATH`?

Let's explore how we would, for example, add a new directory of programs to our command repertoire.
Recall that `PATH` stores a list of directories to find commands in and, for commands in nonstandard places, we must typically execute them via their path:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ ls /home/hacker/scripts
goodscript	badscript	okayscript
hacker@dojo:~$ goodscript
bash: goodscript: command not found
hacker@dojo:~$ /home/hacker/scripts/goodscript
YEAH! This is the best script!
hacker@dojo:~$
```

If you maintain useful scripts that you want to be able to launch by bare name, this is annoying.
However, by adding directories to or replacing directories in this list, you can expose these programs to be launched using their bare name!
For example:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ PATH=/home/hacker/scripts
hacker@dojo:~$ goodscript
YEAH! This is the best script!
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Let's practice.
This level's `/challenge/run` will run the `win` command via its bare name, but this command exists in the `/challenge/more_commands/` directory, which is not initially in the PATH.
The `win` command is the _only_ thing that `/challenge/run` needs, so you can just overwrite `PATH` with that one directory.
Good luck!
