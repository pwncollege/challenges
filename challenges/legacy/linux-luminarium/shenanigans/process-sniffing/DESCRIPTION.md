Poor Zardus; you've hacked him pretty heavily.
But he's wisened up and secured his home directory!
Game over?

Not quite!
One of the things that people often don't think about when there are multiple accounts on one computer is what kind of data their _command invocations_ leak.
Remember, when you do `ps aux`, you get:

```
hacker@dojo:~$ ps aux

But what would happen if one of the arguments of one of those commands was something sensitive, like the flag or a password?
This happens, and nefarious users sharing the same machine (or somehow otherwise listing processes on it) can steal that data and use it!

That's what this challenge explores.
Zardus is using an automation script, passing his account password to it as an argument.
Zardus is also allowed to use `sudo` (and, thus, to `sudo cat /flag`!).
Steal the password, log in to Zardus' account (recall the `su` command from the [Untangling Users](/linux-luminarium/users) module), and get that flag!
