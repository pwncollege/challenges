Alright, so the filesystem starts at `/`.
Under that, there are a whole mess of other directories, configuration files, programs, and, most importantly, _flags_.
In this level, we've added a program right in `/`, called `pwn`, that will give you the flag.
All you need to do for this level is to invoke this program!

You can invoke a program by providing its path on the command line.
In this case, you'll be giving the exact path, starting from `/`, so the path would be `/pwn`.
This style of path, one that starts with the root directory, is referred to as an "absolute path".

Start the challenge, launch a terminal, invoke the `pwn` program using its absolute path, and Capture that Flag!
Good luck!
