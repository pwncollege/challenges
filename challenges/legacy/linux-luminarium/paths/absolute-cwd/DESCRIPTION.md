The Linux filesystem has tons of directories with tons of files.
You can navigate around directories by using the `cd` (`c`hange `d`irectory) command and passing a path to it as an argument, as so:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ cd /some/new/directory
hacker@dojo:/some/new/directory$
```

This affects the "current working directory" of your process (in this case, the bash shell).
Each process has a directory in which it's currently hanging out.
The reasons for this will become clear later in the module.

As an aside, now you can see what the `~` was in the prompt!
It shows the current path that your shell is located at.

This challenge will require you to execute the `/challenge/run` program from a specific path (which it will tell you).
You'll need to `cd` to that directory before rerunning the challenge program.
Good luck!
