First things first: file ownership.
Every file in Linux is owned by a user on the system.
Most often, in your day-to-day life, that user is the user you log in as every day.

On a shared system (such as in a computer lab), there might be many people with different user accounts, all with their own files in their own home directories.
But even on a non-shared system (such as your personal PC), Linux still has many "service" user accounts for different tasks.

The two most important user accounts are:

1. Your user account! On pwn.college, this is the `hacker` user, regardless of what your username is.
2. `root`. This is the administrative account and, in most security situations, the ultimate prize. If you take over the `root` user, you've almost certainly achieved your hacking objective!

So what?
Well, it turns out that the way that we prevent you from just doing `cat /flag` is by having `/flag` owned by the `root` user, configure its permissions so that no other user can read it (you will learn how to do that later), and configure the actual challenge to run as the `root` user (you will learn how to do this later as well).
The result is that when you do `cat /flag`, you get:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l /flag
-r-------- 1 root root 53 Jul  4 04:47 /flag
hacker@dojo:~$ cat /flag
cat: /flag: Permission denied
hacker@dojo:~$
```

Here, you can see that the flag is owned by the `root` user (the first `root` in that line) and the `root` group (the second `root` in that line).
When we try to read it as the `hacker` user, we are denied.
However, if we were `root` (a hacker's dream!), we would have no problem reading this file:

```console
root@dojo:~# cat /flag
pwn.college{demo_flag}
root@dojo:~#
```

Interestingly, we can change the ownership of files!
This is done via the `chown` (**ch**ange **own**er) command:

```
chown [username] [file]
```

Typically, `chown` can only be invoked by the `root` user.
Let's pretend that we're `root` again (that never gets old!), and watch a typical use of `chown`:

```console
root@dojo:~# mkdir pwn_directory
root@dojo:~# touch college_file
root@dojo:~# ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    0 May 22 13:42 college_file
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 May 22 13:42 pwn_directory
root@dojo:~# chown hacker college_file
root@dojo:~# ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker root    0 May 22 13:42 college_file
drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root 4096 May 22 13:42 pwn_directory
root@dojo:~#
```

`college_file`'s owner has been changed to the `hacker` user, and now `hacker` can do with it whatever `root` had been able to do with it!
If this was the `/flag` file, that means that the `hacker` user would be able to read it!

In this level, we will practice changing the owner of the `/flag` file to the `hacker` user, and then read the flag.
For this challenge only, I made it so that you can use chown to your heart's content as the `hacker` user (again, typically, this requires you to be `root`).
Use this power wisely and chown away!
