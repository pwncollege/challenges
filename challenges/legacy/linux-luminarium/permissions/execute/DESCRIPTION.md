So far, you have mostly been dealing with _read_ permissions.
This makes sense, because you have been making the `/flag` file readable to read it.
In this level, we will explore execute permissions.

When you invoke a program, such as `/challenge/run`, Linux will only actually execute it if you have execute-access to the program file.
Consider:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l /challenge/run
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    0 May 22 13:42 /challenge/run
hacker@dojo:~$ /challenge/run
Successfully ran the challenge!
hacker@dojo:~$
```

In this case, `/challenge/run` runs because it is executable by the `hacker` user.
Because the file is owned by the `root` user and `root` group, this requires that the execute bit is set on the `other` permissions.
If we remove these permissions, the execution will fail!

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ chmod o-x /challenge/run
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l /challenge/run
-rwxr-xr-- 1 root root    0 May 22 13:42 /challenge/run
hacker@dojo:~$ /challenge/run
bash: /challenge/run: Permission denied
hacker@dojo:~$
```

In this challenge, the `/challenge/run` program will give you the flag, but you must first make it executable!
Remember your `chmod`, and get `/challenge/run` to tell you the flag!
