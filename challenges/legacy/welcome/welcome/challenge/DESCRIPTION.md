The actual files comprising the challenge live in the `/challenge` directory.
Unlike previous challenges, which automatically ran when the terminal was opened, this challenge requires you to invoke the `/challenge/solve` program directly!

If you happen to lack this knowledge, we recommend you to first complete the [Linux Luminarium](/linux-luminarium) dojo, then resume this module!
