So far, our `WHERE` conditions have been pretty simple.
This challenge complicates it somewhat by injection decoy data into your database.
Luckily, the flag tag is back.

You'll need to filter on _both_ the flag tag and the flag value.
Analogous to other programming languages, you can join together conditional expressions with boolean operators such as `AND` and `OR`.
Craft a powerful expression and filter the flag from the decoys!
