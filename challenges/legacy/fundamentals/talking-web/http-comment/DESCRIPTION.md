HTTP is the _HyperText_ Transfer Protocol.
HyperText, named in the techno-optimism of the late 20th century, is text that carries additional data regarding _how_ it should be understood, not just what it means.
In modern times, this is done through a variety of means: HTTP is used to transport lots of different types of resources, and your web browser combines them to construct the websites that you see and interact with.
The oldest of these is the HyperText Markup Language, or HTML.

HTML describes, in a way that the browser can interpret, the elements that should (initially) appear on a web page.
We'll dive into HTML subtleties in later modules, but here, we'll practice piercing the veil of the website and looking at the HTML behind it all.
You'll need to, as before, find the endpoint and access it in the in-dojo browser.
However, the HTML sent over will _hide_ the flag.
You'll need to figure out how to view the Page Source of the HTML, rather than the rendered result, to access this hidden data.
