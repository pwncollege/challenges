Let's start your journey through encodings with something simple.
This program takes a password, but you have no way to know what it is...
unless you _READ_ it!

In most cybersecurity analysis settings, you will be analyzing software that you did not write, like this program.
Thus, the very first skill you will learn in this module is to read software to understand what is the data that it wants you to send.
We'll start with this trivial Python program.

The program lives in `/challenge/runme`, and will request a tricky password before it gives you the flag.
It's going to be the simplest program you read in your journey, as it just reads data over standard input and makes one simple check.

Read the program, understand the Python, and make the program give you the flag!
