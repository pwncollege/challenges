The available space in `/home/hacker` in this container is a measly **1 gigabyte**.
In this level you will clog up `/home/hacker` with so much junk that even a tiny 1 megabyte file can't be created.
When this happens, your workspace becomes unusable.
We'll practice inducing this in this challenge, and then expand on it a bit later.

How to fill the disk?
There are so many ways.
Here, we'll teach you the `yes` command!

```
hacker@dojo:~$ yes | head
y
y
y
y
y
y
y
y
y
y
hacker@dojo:~$
```

The `yes` outputs `y` over and over forever.
The typical usage is to automate confirmation prompts ("Are you sure you want to delete this file?") using piping, but we'll use it here to make a massive file full of "y" lines.
Just redirect `yes` to a file in your home directory, and you'll fill your disk in a minute or two!

This challenge forces you to fill the disk and then clean up.
The process:

1. Fill your disk.
2. Run `/challenge/check`. It will attempt to create a 1 megabyte temporary file. If that fails, you pass the first stage and the checker will ask you to free the space.
3. Delete the file you made (with `rm`) to clear up the space.
4. Run `/challenge/check` a second time.  If it can now create the temporary file (i.e., you successfully cleaned up your home directory), you’ll receive the flag.

**Why two stages?**
Your home directory persists across challenge instances.
If we let you keep it full, your pwn.college will stop working.
This is _by far_ the most common cause of weird issues on pwn.college!

**HELP IT BROKE!**
If you fill the disk and don't clean it up afterwards, you'll need to `ssh` in to fix things (by removing that file).
This is a bit tricky, but we describe how to do it under "Connecting over SSH" in the [Getting Started](/welcome/welcome) module.
