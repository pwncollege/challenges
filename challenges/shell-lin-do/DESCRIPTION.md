For years, or months, or maybe just days, you have used the shell without meditating deeply on its significance.
Do not be distressed: it is normal to overlook that which is familiar.
But the shell is _not_ a static, boring tool to be used.
It is an _Art_, and those that master it can unlock great power unknown to the rank and file of commandline users.

In this dojo, we shall study this art together.
Perhaps, one day, we will look back on this journey with a feeling of fulfillment and say: `exit 0`.

This dojo is open source!
