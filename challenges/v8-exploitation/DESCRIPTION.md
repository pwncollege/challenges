Welcome to the world of browser exploitation!
In this set of challenges, you can explore Chromium's Javascript engine, V8.
In each challenge, a custom patch is introduced to a version of v8, and you're given the patch, build options, as well as the d8 binary.
[d8](https://v8.dev/docs/d8) is the developer shell of the v8 engine.

The core of this content originally launched as the 2024 Fall Quarterly Quiz, written by [sinamhdv](https://github.com/sinamhdv)!
We've sinced built it out into a longer curriculum to make you a v8 exploitation ninja!
