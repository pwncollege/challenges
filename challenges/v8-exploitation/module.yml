  Welcome to the 2024 fall Quarterly Quiz, and to the world of browser exploitation! In this set of challenges, you can explore Chromium's Javascript engine, V8.

  In each challenge, a custom patch is introduced to a version of v8, and you're given the patch, build options, as well as the d8 binary.  [d8](https://v8.dev/docs/d8) is the developer shell of the v8 engine.

      V8 has a number of helpful runtime functions for debugging that can be activated with the `--allow-natives-syntax` flag. [Here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/v8/v8.git/+/05720af2b09a18be5c41bbf224a58f3f0618f6be:src/runtime/runtime.h;l=574) is a list of them from V8's source code.

      `DebugPrint()` is particularly useful in inspecting an object's memory layout!
