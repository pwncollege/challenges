TOWER → SLEIGH:
    Tower to Sleigh, do you copy? Your position reports are no longer
    matching our tracking. Please confirm your heading.

SLEIGH → TOWER:
    Copy, Tower. Conditions have changed. We’ve lost our reference
    point in the upper air. Instruments aren’t updating. The aurora is
    shifting unpredictably, and the reindeer teams are holding, but only just.

TOWER → SLEIGH:
    Sleigh, we show you drifting toward restricted airspace. You need
    to correct immediately. Stand by while we review the guidance
    archive.

SLEIGH → TOWER:
    Tower, we need that reference now. Without it, we can’t plot a
    safe course forward. Everything up here looks identical—especially
    with the aurora washing out our visual markers.

TOWER → SLEIGH:
    Understood. Accessing the archive… negative. The flag is not
    present. Without it, we cannot compute your corrective vector.

SLEIGH → TOWER:
    Tower, control is degrading. We cannot hold this altitude much
    longer. If you have the flag, transmit it immediately—it's the
    only data that will get Santa safely through this corridor.

[static begins to rise]

TOWER:
    Sleigh, your signal is breaking. Repeat your last transmission.

[static overtakes the channel]

TOWER:
    Sleigh, do you read? Respond.

[silence]

TOWER:
    We've lost contact.

    Whoever is still listening on this frequency:
    the flag is our only means of restoring guidance.
    Recover it and return it on this channel.

    Santa’s counting on you.
