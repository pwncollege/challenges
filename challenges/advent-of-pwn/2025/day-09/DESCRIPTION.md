This year, Santa decided you’ve been especially good and left you a shiny new **Python Processing Unit (pypu)** — a mysterious PCIe accelerator built to finally quiet all the elves who won’t stop grumbling that **“Python is slow”** 🐍💨. This festive silicon snack happily devours `.pyc` bytecode at hardware speed… but Santa forgot to include any userspace tools, drivers, or documentation for how to actually use it. 🎁 All you’ve got is a bare MMIO interface, a device that will execute whatever `.pyc` you can wrangle together, and the hope that you can coax this strange gift into revealing an *extra* gift. Time to poke, prod, reverse-engineer, and see what surprises your new holiday hardware is hiding under the tree. 🎄✨
