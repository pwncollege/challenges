Every year, Santa maintains the legendary Naughty-or-Nice list, and despite the rumors, there’s no magic behind it at all—it’s pure, meticulous byte-level bookkeeping. Your job is to apply every tiny change exactly and confirm the final list matches *perfectly*—check it once, check it twice, because Santa does not tolerate even a single incorrect byte. At the North Pole, it’s all just static analysis anyway: even a simple `objdump | grep naughty` goes a long way.
