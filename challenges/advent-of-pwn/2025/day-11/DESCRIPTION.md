🎅🎄 **A Surprise From the Bottom of Santa’s Bag…** ✨  
While Santa was unloading gifts this year, something *thumped* at the very bottom of his Christmas bag.  
After brushing off a blizzard of stale cookie crumbs ❄️🍪, he discovered…

🖥️ **A BRAND NEW COMPUTER!** 💾  
(Brand new… **in 1994**, that is.)

It comes with a stack of **vintage floppy disks**, a power brick that absolutely should not be this warm 🔌🔥, and a handwritten North Pole Tech Support card that simply reads:

> *“Good luck setting it up! Ho-ho-retro!”*

So fire up that beige box, pop in a floppy or three, and prepare yourself—  
because nothing says *Happy Holidays* like convincing 30-year-old hardware to connect to the network! 🎁

When things inevitably go sideways, don’t panic—  
📞 **NORTH POLE TECH SUPPORT:** **1-800-242-8478**  
🧝‍♂️🔧 North Pole elves are standing by to assist you with any tech-support needs.  
*Seriously. Call them. They'd be happy to help; just let them know what you're seeing.*

Once you’ve got the system up and running—and after you’ve battled the screeching modem 📡 to get online—  
🎁 **connect to `192.168.13.37` on port `1337` to earn your flag.**
