Earlier this season, you pulled off a holiday miracle by helping Santa **compute** the legendary Naughty-or-Nice List from scratch.  
With Christmas approaching, Santa sat down to perform his time-honored ritual:  
**check the list once, then check it again.**

But this year, both checks led to the same unsettling result.

Instead of the tidy columns of names and verdicts he expected, Santa found the list filled with unreadable, unintelligible… *stuff.*  
Not names. Not classifications. Not even coal-worthy scribbles.  
Just sheer, bewildering nonsense.

The elves are whispering about misaligned enchantments.  
Rudolph blames a “data blizzard.”  
Santa insists he followed the procedure correctly, which only raises more questions.

One thing’s clear:

🎅 **The list you computed is there — it’s just not making sense to anyone yet.**

Now it’s up to you to dig into the underlying structure, figure out what the list *should* say, and help Santa restore order before the sleigh leaves the hangar.

Because if Santa checks it a *third* time and it’s still nonsense…  
**Christmas may get cancelled this year.**

**Only you can save Christmas!**
