Did you ever wonder how Santa manages to deliver *sooo* many presents in one night?

---

Dashing through the code,<br>
In a one-ring I/O sled,<br>
O’er the syscalls go,<br>
No blocking lies ahead!<br>
Buffers queue and spin,<br>
Completions shining bright,<br>
What fun it is to read and write,<br>
Async I/O tonight — hey!
