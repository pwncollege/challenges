**Wow, Zardus thinks he’s Santa 🎅**, offering a cheerful Naughty-or-Nice checker on `http://localhost/` — but in typical holiday overkill, it has been served as a full festive *turducken*: **a bright, welcoming outer roast 🦃**, **a warm, well-seasoned middle stuffing 🦆**, and **a rich, indulgent core that ties the whole dish together 🐔**. It all looks merry enough at first glance, yet the whole thing feels suspiciously overstuffed 🎁. Carve into this holiday creation and see what surprises have been tucked away at the center.
