In the previous level, GDB automatically quit for you.
Now it's your turn!

When you're done working in GDB, you exit it with the `quit` command (or just `q`):

```gdb
(gdb) quit
```

In this level, we'll still handle the analysis for you.
All you need to do is launch GDB, let the magic happen, and then type `quit` to exit.
