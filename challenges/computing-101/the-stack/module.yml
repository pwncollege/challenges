description: |
  So far, you've been reading from memory addresses that we set up for you.
  But your program already has a region of memory ready to go: the **stack**.
  The stack is pointed to by the `rsp` register, and it contains useful data about how your program was launched and accumulates other data as the program executes.
  Let's explore it!
challenges:
- id: mem-stack
  name: "The Stack"
- id: mem-stack-offsets
  name: "Stack Offsets"
- id: mem-argv1
  name: "Program Arguments on the Stack"
- id: mem-pop
  name: "Popping From the Stack"
