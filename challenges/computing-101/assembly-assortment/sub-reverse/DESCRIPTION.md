In the previous challenge, the program used `add` to transform your input before checking it.
This time, it uses `sub` (as in, **sub**tract) instead.
Analogous to `add`, `sub rax, 42` will subtract 42 from `rax` and store the result in `rax`.

Otherwise, this challenge is the same as the previous one.
Go get it!
